#### Description
The GuideWire DevTrails Hackathon 2025 was a 45-day event organized by Guidewire, focused on building a system to identify and mitigate Kubernetes failures before they occur. The competition had two phases. In the first phase, we were tasked with finding or creating a dataset containing Kubernetes failures and their characteristics, then developing an AI model to predict or classify system behavior. In the second phase, we extended this AI model into a remediation system capable of predicting or classifying metrics and automatically preventing failures before they happened.

A major challenge we faced was the lack of publicly available datasets on Kubernetes failures. Since synthetic data often lacked realism, we decided to generate our own dataset. To do this, we built a Kubernetes cluster from scratch, intentionally introduced chaos into it, and collected detailed failure metrics. This hands-on approach not only provided us with realistic data but also gave us deep exposure to Kubernetes internals. Overall, the hackathon was an enriching experience that pushed our limits and gave us the opportunity to innovate under real-world constraints.
