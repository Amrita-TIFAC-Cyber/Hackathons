### Description
At Codeathon Thiran 2025, one of the challenge themes was "Zero Hunger", inspired by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). In response, our team created [FoodLink](), a web application designed to bridge the gap between restaurants with surplus food and NGOs in need. The app allows restaurants to log in, update details on surplus food such as type, quantity, and location and makes this data visible to registered NGOs who can then request pickups.
